# CaptureTheFlag.FinalProject
This was the final project for my cybersecurity bootcamp program. It was a capture the flag project in which my group and I acted as security engineers for XCORP. XCORP's SOC analysts noticed discrepencies in the Kibana logs and asked us to investigate. We were tasked to create kibana alerts and then test them.
